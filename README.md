# We-Got-The-Same-EBS-WGTSE
This is an open-source repository that aims to get the Formula SAE Autonomous team getting their safety features (Emergency breaking system) online as soon as possible. This open source repo is still new! We encourage everyone to join together so we can pass the AV1 scruit together for 2024!!!!

PS: Thanks Karthik Sunderasan from Western Sydney University and Katia Wild from University of Technology Syndey for raising this idea!!!!
